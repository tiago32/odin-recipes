    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 chicken leg quarters</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, paprika, oregano, sea salt, chili powder, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, and black pepper. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Season the chicken with a pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Grill the chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
